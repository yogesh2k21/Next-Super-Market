# NEXT SUPER MARKET   üîó [Live Link](http://13.126.12.72:3000/)

Our e-commerce platform is a unique blend of cutting-edge technologies and robust software engineering principles. At its core, our platform is built with Django for the backend, which provides a secure, scalable, and flexible foundation for managing customer data and transactions. On the frontend, we use Next.js, a high-performance React-based framework, to provide users with a seamless and responsive experience.

Styling the platform is made effortless with the help of TailwindCSS, a utility-first CSS framework that allows us to create beautiful and functional interfaces with ease. To store our data, we have chosen SQLite, a powerful and lightweight database solution that is well-suited for small to medium-sized applications.

To ensure secure authentication and authorization, we have implemented JSON Web Tokens (JWT) on our platform. Payments are processed smoothly and securely through Razorpay, a leading payment gateway in India. And after a successful order is placed, our platform sends a detailed email to the user with their order information, thanks to our implementation of Celery, a Python library for asynchronous task execution.

All of these technologies come together to create a powerful and user-friendly e-commerce platform that delivers a fantastic user experience. Our platform is designed for reliability, performance, and security, making it a great choice for businesses looking for a comprehensive e-commerce solution.

##  Requirements üèóÔ∏è

Requirements to run our e-commerce platform:

- Docker installed on your system
- At least 4 GB of RAM available
- A web browser, such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Microsoft Edge
- A stable internet connection

Note: The application has been tested on Linux and macOS, but it should also run on Windows with Docker installed. The required packages and dependencies are included in the Docker containers, so you do not need to install anything manually on your system.

## Installation & Setup üè≠

To set up and install our containerized e-commerce platform using Docker, follow these steps:

- Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine
- Navigate to the project directory
- Run the following command to build the Docker containers: `docker-compose build`
- Start the containers using the following command: `docker-compose up`
- Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the e-commerce platform.

Note: The entire application has been containerized using Docker, ensuring that the application is portable and can be easily deployed on any system with Docker installed. If you make any changes to the code, you may need to rebuild the containers and restart the application. You can do this by running the `docker-compose down` command followed by `docker-compose up`.

## Hosting & Deployment ‚òÅÔ∏è

This e-commerce platform has been hosted on Amazon EC2 as part of my journey to learn about AWS and containerized using Docker.
By using Docker, the application has been packaged into a container that can be easily moved between development, testing, and production environments.
AWS provides a wide range of cloud computing services, and hosting this application on EC2 has been a great opportunity to dive deeper into the platform. 
By hosting on EC2, I was able to gain hands-on experience with cloud computing and improve my skills in this area.
